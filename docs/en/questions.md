# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## Feature support

### Does it support BLE devices?

Certainlyï¼Œ`SerialPort` fully supports BLE devices since version `4.0.0`.

### Is there an automatic reconnection mechanism?

## Common problem

### Why is the list of available devices for a custom page empty?

After Android 6.0, you must give the positioning permission to search for available devices.

### Why does the BLE device connect successfully, but cannot send and receive messages, and sometimes an exception occurs?

After the BLE device is successfully connected, it is necessary to set the correct UUID for normal communication.For the specific setting method, see [Set BLE device UUID](./tutorials/discovery_connect_kotlin.html#ble)
